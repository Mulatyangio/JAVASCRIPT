//what are variables?
//vaiables are ways to store data in memory/ram as a program/app is running
//in Javascript we declae variables using var, let or const keywords
var age = 90
//var is globally scopped
//let and const are block{}scopped
let username = "victor"
const PI = 3.142
//we use = to assign values to our variables
//when the application is running, we can access these values using the variable name

console.log(age);//90
console.log(age);//90
console.log(username); //victor
console.log(PI * 2);//6.284

//you cannot reassign to a constant variable eg PI = 4.2 // trying to reassingn to a constant variable--type error
